                Arrays are one of the first data structures that you will be introduced to first for primitive
        data types and then objects. If you have some basic programming experience then you should
        already have met the materials with in this topic.
        \n
        \n
        Below is a brief overview of each of the topics covered in this topic:
        \n
        \n
        Declaring Arrays of Length - Learn to declare an array of a fixed length.
        \n
        \n
        Declaring Array with values - Learn to declare an array with values on declaration.
        \n
        \n

        The following shows the declaration of an array, but the contents of the array would be set to 0 by default.

        The following shows the declaration as well as initialization of the values in the array.
        \n
        The length is defined by the amount of objects (in this case numbers) within the curly brackets.

        \n
        int[] myIntArray = {1,2,3};

       a linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
        Each node is composed of a data and a reference (in other words, a link),
        to the next node in the sequence. more complex variants add additional links.
        This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.
        \n
        Here is an example of a singly linkedlist:

        \n
        \n
        Here is an example of a doubly linkedlist:

    <string name="linkedList_introduction_other_topics">
        Through the topics and examples give in this topic we will
        use singly linked nodes until doubly linked are required.
        \n
